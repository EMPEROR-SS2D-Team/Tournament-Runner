# Tournament Runner
### You can use Tournament Runner to run Soccer Simulation 2D tournaments.
-------------------------------------------

### :gear: Get started

First you should put all the binaries in `Bins` directory. All binaries must contain `localStartAll` and `start` script.

To run a tournament, put list of the games in `Games.txt` and then, execute `Run.sh` with
```
./Run.sh
```
After the games are finished, you can see logs (.rcg and .rcl) files compressed to .tar.gz in Logs directory. 

Also you can see Holes and Clashes in the terminal when the games are finished.

-------------------------------------------

### Note: This Repository uses [HoleAnalyzer](https://github.com/RCSS-IR/HoleAnalyzer) for analyzing Holes&Clashes.
